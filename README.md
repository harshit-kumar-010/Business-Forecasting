# Business Forecasting - Sales Revenue Prediction for Adidas
This project aims to forecast the future sales revenue of Adidas using Time Series Forecasting.

The dataset contains quarterly sales revenue of Adidas from 2000 to 2021.

# Dataset Features
•	Time Period: Year and Quarter

•	Revenue: Sales revenue of Adidas in every quarter

# Project Goals
The main objective of this project is to forecast the revenue of Adidas for the next n number of quarters using the SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) Model.

# Libraries Used
•	Pandas

•	NumPy

•	Statsmodels

•	Matplotlib

# Files in Repository
•	Adidas-quartely-sales.csv: Dataset file containing quarterly sales revenue of Adidas

•	Adidas_SARIMA_Model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of SARIMA model for forecasting the revenue of Adidas

# Results
The SARIMA model was successfully implemented and used to forecast the revenue of Adidas for the next 8 quarters. 

The predicted results were then plotted using Matplotlib.

# Future Improvements
•	Experiment with other models like Prophet, LSTM and GRU for comparison of the results.

•	Explore the effect of external factors on sales revenue of Adidas, such as marketing campaigns, sports events, and global economic situations.

# References
•	The SARIMA model implementation is based on the article "A Comprehensive Guide to Time Series Analysis in Python" by Jason Brownlee.
